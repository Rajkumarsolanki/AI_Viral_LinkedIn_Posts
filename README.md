I stopped staring at a blank LinkedIn post editor.
So I built an AI system that *never* runs out of viral post ideas. 😅⚙️

Here’s what it does 👇

🔁 **Step 1 – Steal like an engineer (ethically):**
It uses **Apify** to scrape top-performing posts from my favourite LinkedIn creators in my niche. No copy-paste, just raw inspiration and patterns that already work.

🧠 **Step 2 – Filter like a smart editor:**
An **AI model (OpenAI)** scores each post for *relevance* to my audience (automation, AI, workflows, builders).
Only the posts that match my target theme move to the next stage.

✍️ **Step 3 – Rewrite in *my* tone of voice:**
A second **AI (OpenAI)** rewrites the selected posts in my own style:

* more practical
* more system-focused
* zero plagiarism
* tailored for the problems my network actually faces

📊 **Step 4 – Build a growing content vault:**
Every original + rewritten post is stored in **Google Sheets** as my personal “Content Bank”:

* Hooks
* Stories
* Carousels ideas
* CTAs
  So I can schedule, remix, and reuse content without starting from scratch.

🛠 **The backbone of the system:**

* **Apify** → Scrape LinkedIn posts
* **n8n** → Orchestrate the entire workflow
* **OpenAI x2** → Relevance check + TOV rewrite
* **Google Sheets** → Content database

Result?
Instead of spending 45 minutes thinking of what to post, I spend 5 minutes selecting what to *ship*.
